# white-van v1.7x
Pre Release autonomous C++ code for the 2021 "Pitching in" Vex IQ White Van robot.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
The White Van is a pusher Vex IQ robot that uses two spin tubes (same design as Fling) to collect balls and push them into the low goal. Currently, the robot can hold 7-8 balls in one run, and consistently keeps them inside. The robot utilizes extensive gear systems to spin the tubes at extremely high rates, to the extent where a touch to the ball is enough to intake it. It uses one tube at the front to eject and intake balls, as well as a tube in the back to push balls closer to the front. While extremely fast, the robot consumes large amounts of energy as the front tube is always spinning. The robot was built from scratch and uses a bumper trigger to start, ensuring the correct position of the bot before starting.

**Currently, only pre releases are available.**
